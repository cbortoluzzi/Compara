Order fish species following the DeepFin.v4 white paper phylogenetic classification (https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-0958-3). 

The python script requires only two inputs: a csv file with the complete phylogenetic classification of bony fishes (i.e. DeepFin_v4.csv) and a tsv file with information on the genome assemblies (i.e. vertebrata_202111.tsv).

The complete phylogenetic classification file can be downloaded from Betancur-R et al. 2017
