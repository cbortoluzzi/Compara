Set of scripts to run our quality metrics on the cactus alignment

Download cactus alignment
The first step we need to take is that of downloading the cactus alignment, step that can be done by simply running the download_hal.sh script as follow:

./download_hal.sh.

The script already contains the path to the cactus alignment, as stored in the Ensembl Rapid Release database.

Validate cactus database
Once we have downloaded the cactus alignment, we want to make sure that the hal database is valid. We can check this by running the valide.sh script:

./validate.sh <name of cactus alignment in hal format>

Coverage of reference genome
In this second step we want to calculate the proportion of sites in species A (i.e. query) that aligns to n or more sites in species B (i.e. target):

./coverage.sh <input hal file> <name of genome to calculate coverage on>

The script will generate 100 random intervals, each 1 Mb long (only autosomes and sex chromosomes are considered). Coverage will be calculated on each 
of these 100 random intervals using the coverage option in maf_stream.
