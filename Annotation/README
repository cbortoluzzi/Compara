Download Ensembl annotation

The python script takes three inputs: 
-table : a tsv file with assembly information;
- csv : a csv file downloaded from Ensembl Rapid release (https://rapid.ensembl.org/info/about/species.html). This file specifies whether the annotation is available for a given assembly;
- metadata : a json file downloaded from Ensembl Rapid release (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/rapid-release/species_metadata.json).
